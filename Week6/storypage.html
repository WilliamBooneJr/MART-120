        <h1>Shortstory</h1>
        <i>There was once a man who was faced with 2 choices. He could choose to sleep in or get up early. 
            He could choose to eat a donut for breakfast or make a nutritous smoothie. When he drives to work, he could either listen to
            a podcast or music. He could choose to work hard at his job or just get through the day. He could binge on social media or he could 
            read a book. He could go hangout with friends or watch a movie. He could go to the gym or take a nap on the couch. This man can choose
            between 2 different lives. The moral of the story is this: Hard choices make an easy life, easy choices make a hard life. Your habits
            are who you become.
